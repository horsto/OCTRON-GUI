Post-installation script that ensures sam-2 correctly overwrites hq-sam-2 files.
This is important since SAM2 has developed further after SAM2HQ was released.
However SAM2HQ uses the same internal package names and therefore is not anymore compatible
with a concurrent installation of both packages.

I am "solving" this here by force reinstalling sam-2 after hq-sam-2 is installed.
